    - title: <a href="https://github.com/amrhmorsy/ocean-simulation">Ocean Simulation</a>
      year:
      description: Ocean simulation, developed in C++ and OpenGL, that uses the Fast Fourier Transform method (FFT) with the assistance of OpenCL to simulate waves. Additionally, it employs Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) and image-based lighting (IBL) techniques to enhance the realism of the oceanic visuals, and an HDR skybox to present dynamic and an immersive sky. 
      
    - title: <a href="https://github.com/amrhmorsy/cloth-simulation">Cloth Simulation</a>
      year:
      description: Cloth simulation, developed in C++ and OpenGL, that employs a Mass-Spring System for realistic cloth, inspired by the paper "Fast Simulation of Mass-Spring Systems" by Liu et al. It uses OpenMP for efficient parallelization and features Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) and Image-Based Lighting (IBL) to enhance the visuals of the simulated cloth.

    - title: <a href="https://github.com/amrhmorsy/OpenGL-Rendering-Engine">OpenGL Rendering Engine</a>
      year:
      description: OpenGL Rendering Engine that features Physically-Based Rendering (PBR), Image-Based Lighting (IBL), HDR skyboxes, and dynamic soft shadows. The engine also leverages Tessellation shaders to dynamically refine mesh detail at runtime and anti-aliasing to reduce visual artifacts, enabling the creation of visually compelling and realistic scenes.

    - title: <a href="https://github.com/amrhmorsy/raytracer">Raytracer</a>
      year:
      description: Advanced Raytracer application, developed in C++, that utilizes OpenMP for parallel computing to enhance performance. The project features global illumination, motion blur, depth of field, soft shadows and Phong Local Illumination.
